 What Does the Black-Scholes Model Do?

Black-Scholes, also known as Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM), was the first widely used model for option pricing. Based on the assumption that instruments, such as stock shares or futures contracts, will have a lognormal distribution of prices following a random walk with constant drift and volatility, and factoring in other important variables, the equation derives the price of a European-style call option. It does so by subtracting the net present value (NPV) of the strike price multiplied by the cumulative standard normal distribution from the product of the stock price and the cumulative standard normal probability distribution function.
